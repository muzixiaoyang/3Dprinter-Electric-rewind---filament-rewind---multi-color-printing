【3D Printer】electric rewinf - filament rewind - multi-color printing
【3D打印机】稳定至上的电动回卷-耗材回卷-多色打印

During multi-color printing,
If you can't solve the winding in the rewind,
It will affect the next filament feeding and printing

The advantage of passive rewinding is that there is no involvement of electronic components.
However, there will be problems such as excessive resistance, complex structure, and large volume

So in the process of developing wood polychrome,
Specially designed for such as rabbit multicolor, TR multicolor, etc.,
Other types of multi-color printing are equipped with a motorized rewinding device
Advantages: cheap and quite cheap, simple structure, strong stability, long working time, long rewinding distance
Cons: Requires one or more USBs to be occupied

在多色打印过程中，
如果不能解决回卷中缠绕，
将会影响下一次耗材的送料与打印

被动回卷的优势在于无电子元器件的参与，
但是会存在着阻力过大，结构复杂，体积较大的问题等

所以在开发木子多色的过程中，
特意为诸如兔子多色，TR多色等，
其他类别的多色打印预备了一套电动回卷装置
优势：价格便宜相当便宜，结构简单，稳定性强，工作时间长，回卷距离长
缺点：需要占用一个或多个USB
